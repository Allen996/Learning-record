Problem Description:
Input Format: The first line contains an integer 𝑛. The second line contains integers 𝑣1, 𝑣2, . . . , 𝑣𝑛 separated
by spaces.
Constraints: 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 20, 1 ≤ 𝑣𝑖 ≤ 30 for all 𝑖.
Output Format: Output 1, if it possible to partition 𝑣1, 𝑣2, . . . , 𝑣𝑛 into three subsets with equal sums, and
0 otherwise

First attempt:
   1\Let's denote V(i,j) as the maximum value that can be reached with first i items with weight limit j.
   2\
   Didn't come out a solution, I'm going to redo the previous problems and come back later.
